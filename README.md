# About the project

https://moveit-taupe-five.vercel.app/

Move-it is an application created with Next.js, builded during the
fourth edition of NLW (Next Level Week), an event organized by Rockteseat (https://rocketseat.com.br/ "Rocketseat website").

The application proposes a healthy solution to people that spend the most of the day in front of a computer working or studying. Using challenges that exercise your muscles and eyes during the the day, you can have a new cicle by starting the countdown of 25 minutes, and after that you will have the proposal to one exercise provided by raffle. If you complete the challenge you will gain experience, gaining experience you will improve your level.
